            This application stands as a testament to a modern, fully automated DevOps workflow.
            It begins with <strong>Antigravity</strong>, a next-generation local development environment that empowers
            builders with AI-driven intelligence and rapid iteration capabilities.
            Source control is robustly managed by <strong>GitHub</strong>, providing a secure, transparent, and
            collaborative foundation for every line of code versioned in the cloud.
            Finally, the deployment pipeline is orchestrated by <strong>Vercel</strong>, which instantly detects
            changes, optimizes the build process, and distributes the application across a global edge network, ensuring
            lightning-fast delivery to users worldwide without manual intervention.
